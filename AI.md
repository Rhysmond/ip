# AI.md

This project (NyanChan Chatbot) used OpenAI's ChatGPT as a coding assistant.

## How AI was used
- I asked ChatGPT to help refactor my chatbot code to be more modular.
- ChatGPT suggested breaking the code into smaller functions, separating logic from UI, and improving readability.
- I also used it to generate example code snippets and explanations, which I adapted into my project.

## What I did
- I designed the overall chatbot logic, dialogue handling, and project structure.
- I tested, debugged, and finalized all code changes.
- All final decisions about architecture and features were made by me.

## Benefits
- Helped me restructure the code into cleaner modules.
- Saved time by providing quick refactoring suggestions.
- Improved maintainability of the project.

## Limitations and Oversight
- Some AI-generated code required debugging or adjustments to work correctly.
- I reviewed and modified all AI-assisted changes to ensure correctness and style consistency.

## Transparency
This project used ChatGPT only for refactoring suggestions and documentation improvements. All logic, design choices, and testing were completed by me.
